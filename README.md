# Social_Network_Example_Project

## What's included?

- Social network project with the use of Semantic UI framework
- Adding posts included like and comment sections 
- Users profile section
- Presentation of relations between users

## Installation

This is developed for Python 3 and Django 3.1.

It's recommended that you setup a virtualenv before development.

Then just install requirements, migrate, and runserver to get started:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

## Customization

I recommend forking this project and just manually modifying it by hand to replace everything with what you want.
Searching for the text on a page in the repository is a great way to find where something lives.
